# **App Name**: AI-STEM Separator: Mad Scientist Edition

## Core Features:

- Audio Upload & Format Buffet: Cram in yer MP3s, FLACs, and WAVs! We'll gobble 'em up, no matter how weirdly encoded.
- U-Net Brain Fryer: Integrate a pre-trained U-Net model – it's been zapped with extra learning for peak audio sorcery! Prepare for your stems to be… unearthly.
- Stem Splatter Process: Fire up the AI-powered stem separation! It's like an audio Jackson Pollock – unpredictable, maybe a bit messy, but undeniably ART.
- Output Stems – FRESHLY SLICED: Grab yer separated stems – vocals, instrumentals, or whatever sonic goo oozed out! Downloadable for maximum remix madness.
- CLI: Command-Line Chaos: Unleash the CLI! A simple portal to stem separation… but beware, cryptic commands may induce existential dread.
- Tool Time with AI Overlord: An AI tool chooses the best stem manipulation, like a super-powered mad scientist, that decides the optimal stem manipulations. Fear its supreme judgment!
- Matrix Digital Rain Button: Adds a button that toggles a Matrix-style digital rain background effect, for extra cyber-madness.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) – 'cause normal blue is for squares.
- Background: Static Gray (#D3D3D3) – like a TV from another dimension.
- Accent: Acid Lime (#A4DD00) – to make your eyes bleed (with delight!).
- Body: Comic Sans MS – yes, we went there. Headline: Impact – because subtlety is overrated.
- Hand-drawn, slightly deranged icons – think Salvador Dali meets MS Paint.
- Asymmetrical and chaotic – like a toddler designed it after 10 cups of coffee.
- Glitches, sparkles, and random explosions during processing – because why not?
